## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iHuman-Lab/rescue-analysis.git
cd rescue-analysis
```

### 2. Always use a conda virtual environment

```bash
   conda activate myenv
```

   *(Replace `myenv` and Python version as needed)*

---

## 🛠️ Pre-commit Setup

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically check your code before commits and pushes, ensuring consistent code quality and style.

### How to install and enable pre-commit hooks:

1. **Ayour conda environment**

   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

   *(Replace `myenv` and Python version as needed)*

2. **Install `pre-commit` in your conda environment**

   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit
   ```

   or if you prefer:

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

3. **Run pre-commit checks manually (optional)**

   To manually run all pre-commit checks on all files:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

---

### Notes:

* Always activate your conda environment before running Git commands to ensure hooks work properly.
* If you update `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, run `pre-commit install` again to update the hooks.
* The `pre-push` hook will run all pre-commit checks before pushing. If any check fails, the push will be aborted.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The project uses a YAML config file at `configs/config.yml`.

```python
import yaml

with open("configs/config.yml") as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)
```

Modify this file to adjust parameters, paths, and flags.

---

## ⏯️ Conditional Execution with `skip_run`

Use the `skip_run` context manager from `utils.py` to control which pipeline blocks run.

Example from `main.py`:

```python
from utils import skip_run

with skip_run("skip", "Data") as check, check():
    # This block will be skipped if flag is "skip"
    ...
```

* Pass `"skip"` to skip blocks
* Pass `"run"` (or anything else) to execute blocks

The utility prints colored console messages indicating running/skipping status.

---

## 🧹 Code Quality

This project uses pre-commit hooks for automated linting and formatting:

* `ruff` for linting and enforcing naming conventions
* `codespell` for typo detection

### Install pre-commit hooks

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```
